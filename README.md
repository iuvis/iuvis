### A little bit about myself

JavaScript developer with around 3 years of experience. I started out in gamedev, building complex in-game interfaces, where attention to detail really mattered. Later, I led a frontend team on a B2B project — a platform for managing and participating in tenders. My main stack includes React, TypeScript, Redux, Zustand, ShadCN, and Framer Motion. I’m also comfortable working full-stack with NestJS, Prisma, Docker, and PostgreSQL.
